Assessment Tasks

Question 1

Select a publicly available dataset 

(a) Consider two variables of the dataset, and develop a decision-making strategy to check
whether two averages of variables are equal at the significant level alpha=0.01.

(b) Consider two variables of the dataset, and develop a decision-making strategy to check
whether two averages of variables are different at the significant level alpha=0.10. 

(c) Consider one variable in the dataset, and apply the test of the mean for a proposed candidate
of ùúá at the significant level alpha=0.05.

To do so,

- State the hypotheses.
- Find the statistic (test) and critical values.
- Explain your decision and Interpret the results.
Question 2

Select a regression publicly available dataset 

a) Build an ordinary least square model (OLS) for your dataset and show the summary
information.

b) Find the intercept and the coefficients, and write the model equation that considers only
significant features.

c) Evaluate your model using an appropriate evaluation metric and find the residuals for each
data point

d) Predict the target values for the last 10 rows in your dataset, and predict one more value
from your suggestion
